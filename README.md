# Dog-Breed-Classification

I found [this](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset) Dataset on Kaggle on wanted to try how good I can train a Deep Learning model on it. 

My first attempt is transfer learning with a VGG16 model trained on Imagenet

Second attempt was using EfficientNeB0, which got me way better results than VGG16.
